## Training Development Lessons

Lessons crystallised from the TRAIN-6 / Option C development cycle (2026-05-13).

**1. Always smoke before a long run.**
Run 100 steps from the current checkpoint before enabling any new training code path. Validates: Metal graph warmup (catches 10–30 min compilation stalls), step timing, memory peak, NaN propagation, and style-loss / EMA / cross-ref interactions. The TRAIN-6 smoke discovered a 45 GB OOM peak (2.25× over budget) that was invisible in profiler benchmarks. Without the smoke, the first production run would have swapped and stalled indefinitely.

**2. Profiler step time ≠ production step time.**
The TRAIN-6 profiler gave 8.38 s/step; the smoke measured 14.2 s/step (1.69× gap). The gap comes from style loss, EMA update, data prefetch, cross-ref permutation, and checkpoint I/O — none of which appear in a synthetic-batch profiler. Always derive production timeline estimates from smoke-measured step time, not profiler numbers. Scale the profiler number by 1.6–1.7× for realistic planning.

**3. Memory peaks are only visible in smoke, not profiler.**
The synthetic profiler batch skips style loss (no reference latent), EMA (no ema_params state), and data prefetch (no concurrent threads). These add ~2–4 GB above the profiler peak. `memory_profile: true` in a real 100-step smoke is the only reliable way to confirm a new backward path fits in 32 GB.

**4. Warmstart comparison understates gradient path quality differences.**
The TRAIN-6 vs old-path 500-step comparison from step 108500 showed mean cond_gap +0.076 (TRAIN-6) vs +0.334 (old path). This gap is largely a warmstart artifact: switching gradient direction after 108K steps on the old path creates a distribution mismatch — the adapter's K/V weights are optimised for a different loss landscape, so the first ~250 steps are spent adjusting (first-half mean: +0.008, near noise). Only a from-scratch comparison or a multi-thousand-step continued run is a fair quality-ceiling test. Treat short warmstart comparisons as efficiency signals, not quality-ceiling signals.

**5. New gradient paths need end-to-end smoke validation, not just unit tests.**
`_flux_forward_with_ip_collect_q` was unit-tested (correct shapes, non-zero Q delta at later blocks). But the full training loop — warmup compilation for all 6 bucket shapes, `adapter.get_image_embeds` called outside `value_and_grad` with real weights, memory peak during the extra forward pass — was not validated until smoke. Unit tests confirm the function is correct; smoke tests confirm it integrates correctly with the rest of the training stack.

## Pipeline / Storage Development Lessons

Lessons crystallised from the PIPELINE-26/27/28/29 implementation and two-pass code review (2026-05-14).

**6. `Path.suffix` truncates at the last dot — watch for multi-extension files.**
`Path("chunk1_final.ema.safetensors").suffix` returns `".safetensors"`, not `".ema.safetensors"`. A glob + suffix-based copy loop for `chunk{N}_final.*` would map both `chunk1_final.safetensors` and `chunk1_final.ema.safetensors` to the same destination name. Whichever glob returns first "wins" — the EMA checkpoint could silently replace the real weights in the cold archive. Fix: enumerate extensions explicitly rather than deriving them from the source filename. Use `Path.suffixes` or name-based filtering (e.g. `".ema." in f.name`) when multi-dot extensions are in scope.

**7. Match manifest keys exactly — don't assume snake_case consistency.**
`cache_manager.py` writes `"record_count"` to `manifest.json`; an early version of `data_explorer.py status` read `"records"` and silently returned 0 for all precompute record counts. The doctor code had already established the correct `m.get("record_count", m.get("records"))` fallback pattern — new code that reads the same manifests must use the same key and fallback. When in doubt: grep for the write site, not for the read site.

**8. Use config-derived paths everywhere, not just for writes.**
The stager's `archive_chunk()` correctly derives `cold_root / "metadata"` from the config. An early version of `shard_scorer.py` used the hardcoded `COLD_METADATA_DIR` constant for its input DB path but the config-derived `cold_root / "metadata"` for its output path. If `cold_root` differs from the default constant, the scorer reads from the wrong place. Rule: derive all storage paths from the same source (config > constant), and be consistent across both read and write paths in the same function.

**9. Two-pass review is worth it for storage-touching code.**
The first review pass (immediately after implementation) caught 4 bugs: missing `load_config` import, wrong fix-command chunk number, absolute symlinks, wrong DB source path. The second pass (after a day) caught 3 more: EMA file collision (`Path.suffix` truncation), wrong manifest key (`records` vs `record_count`), and path-source inconsistency in `shard_scorer.py`. Storage code modifies persistent state — bugs here can corrupt cold archives silently for many chunks before detection. Budget for at least two review passes before first production use.

## Platform Vision & Long-term Architecture

**Goal:** evolve iris.c from a fast inference engine into a fully autonomous, self-improving `--sref` optimization platform — running continuous flywheel campaigns (days/weeks/months) that automatically improve both training data and hyperparameters, culminating in open-weight release of a high-quality IP-Adapter.

### Dual Flywheel System

└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The meta flywheel decides what to train on and with what config. The main flywheel executes and feeds metrics back. Cold storage accumulates the knowledge: each campaign extends shard score history, adds scored configs to ablation history, and archives weights. Every new campaign starts smarter than the last.

### Warm-Start as a First-Class Principle

Starting fresh is the expensive fallback, not the default. Every layer of the system must support warm-starting from prior state:

- **Training:** new campaigns warm-start from the best archived checkpoint for the target config. `data_explorer.py --suggest-warmstart` emits the exact `--warmstart` + `--precompute-version` flags.
- **Ablation harness:** on startup, loads `ablation_history.db` and pre-seeds the Optuna TPE study with all prior scored runs before suggesting new candidates. A new campaign instantly inherits the full Pareto frontier from prior work — no redundant exploration.
- **Precompute:** `cache_manager.py --warm-start-precompute <old_version>` copies embeddings for shards whose encoder did not change, skipping full recompute on partial updates. 6-month-old embeddings remain valid if the encoder is unchanged.
- **Shard selection:** `shard_scores.db` accumulates cond_gap and CLIP-I contributions across all campaigns; scores improve with each run. The meta flywheel never starts from zero.

This compounds: the 10th campaign benefits from 9 campaigns of shard intelligence, hyperparameter Pareto history, and weight lineage — dramatically narrowing the search space and reducing time-to-quality.

### Cold Storage as Long-term Knowledge Base

Cold storage is not a backup or overflow — it is the primary accumulator of system intelligence:

- **`metadata/shard_scores.db`** — never truncated; score history grows with every campaign. The meta flywheel scores shards from the full history, not just the most recent run.
- **`metadata/ablation_history.db`** — every ablation run ever recorded, across all campaigns. The Optuna study is rebuilt from this on each new run; the Pareto frontier only improves.
- **`weights/flywheel-*/`** — full checkpoint lineage. Enables warm-starting any future experiment, bisecting quality regressions, and comparing approaches tried months apart.
- **`precompute/v*/`** — versioned encoder outputs that remain valid indefinitely for unchanged encoders.

**Rule:** cold storage is append-only except for explicit operator-triggered garbage collection. Pipeline operations never touch the raw pool, weight archives, or metadata databases.

### Storage Architecture

Three-tier design (target state — current system is hot + cold only):

- **Ultrahot tier** (internal NVMe SSD, ~2–8 TB) — lowest-latency path for the live inference server and web app. Holds only the active weights and embeddings needed to serve requests. Populated by the stager from hot; never written to by training.
- **Hot storage** (`/Volumes/2TBSSD`, 2 TB TB5 SSD) — fast working area for the active + next compute window only. Pipeline reads shards, precompute, and weights from here during training.
- **Cold storage** (`/Volumes/16TBCold`, 16 TB spinning disk) — source of truth and long-term knowledge base. Never auto-deleted by pipeline operations.

**JIT Data Stager** manages all directions:
- **Cold → Hot (staging):** before a compute window, stages raw data, precompute, and weights from cold to hot. Uses symlinks when on the same filesystem (near-instant); atomic copies across filesystems. `_check_hot_space()` enforces `staging_margin_gb` before any transfer.
- **Hot → Cold (archiving):** after a successful run, archives newly generated precompute embeddings, weight checkpoints, and per-campaign telemetry to cold. This is the write path — without it, cold never grows and warm-starts never improve.
- **Hot → Inference (promote):** after archiving, copies or symlinks the active checkpoint + its precompute version to the Ultrahot tier so the web app picks up new weights without restarting.

All directions are first-class operations. Staging populates the working set; archiving accumulates the knowledge; promotion makes results live. See **PIPELINE-30** for implementation.

### Proposed cold storage layout

```
/Volumes/16TBCold/
├── raw/
│   ├── journeydb/          # persistent tgz pool — never auto-deleted
│   └── journeydb_anno/     # annotation index — downloaded once, kept
├── precompute/             # versioned encoder caches (managed by cache_manager.py)
│   ├── v1/
│   ├── v2/ …
│   ├── current/            # symlink → active version
│   └── manifests/          # per-version coverage manifests
├── weights/                # archived IP-Adapter weights + checkpoints
│   ├── flywheel-YYYYMMDD/  # one dir per campaign
│   └── best/               # symlinks → current best weights per metric
├── metadata/               # persistent telemetry — never reset between campaigns
│   ├── shard_scores.db     # scored shard history (feeds meta flywheel)
│   ├── ablation_history.db # all ablation runs ever (feeds Optuna warm-start)
│   └── flywheel_logs/      # structured per-campaign JSON logs
├── reports/                # all HTML reports (flywheel, ablation, shard selection)
├── temp/                   # staging area for in-progress transfers
└── logs/                   # operational logs (pipeline, orchestrator)
```

This layout is the target state. Current hot-storage paths under `/Volumes/2TBSSD/` remain unchanged during the transition; the stager will progressively migrate source-of-truth data to cold as PIPELINE-25/26/29 land.

### Hardware scaling roadmap

Current: M1 Max, 32 GB unified memory, 2 TB hot + 16 TB cold.
Future: M5 Max Mac Studio (projected ~128–192 GB unified memory, dramatically higher compute). The dual-flywheel architecture, cold storage layout, and versioned precompute design are all intended to scale without structural changes — only config and scale parameters change. The accumulated knowledge base (shard scores, ablation history, weight archive) carries forward directly to any new hardware.

## Training & Model Quality

**TRAIN-7: IP-Adapter production quality roadmap** (High priority, next major release)

Proof-of-concept validated (2026-05-11, `train/reports/ip_adapter_v1/`): the adapter architecture and training signal are sound. The model responds to the style reference with coherent, stable output (CLIP-I 0.53, no NaN, correct image structure). The gap to production quality is entirely a matter of scale and refinement — no architectural rethink is required. The following improvements are known to provide benefit, roughly in priority order:

1. **Larger resolution + more training steps** — the v1 run was a `--small` configuration. Higher resolution (1024px) exposes finer style features to the SigLIP encoder; more steps allow the PerceiverResampler and K/V projections to build a richer style space. Expected CLIP-I gain: +0.05–0.10. **Note (32 GB):** 1024px training on 4B Flux currently peaks at ~26 GB at 512px; 1024px roughly doubles the sequence length (256→1024 image tokens), which increases attention memory. Feasibility needs a short profiling run before committing to a full 1024px flywheel.

**Dependency summary:** Item 1 (resolution/scale) — unblocked, needs 1024px memory profiling run. Items 2–4 (TRAIN-6, PIPELINE-27, QUALITY-10) — done, see COMPLETED_BACKLOG.md.

## Pipeline Improvements

**PIPE-ORCH-1: Orchestrator coverage gaps — paths not exercised by smoke run** (Low priority, code bugs fixed)

Smoke run 3 (2026-05-11) validated the happy path across all 14 steps × 2 chunks. Three code bugs found in audit were fixed (commit `cdd9fb0`, 2026-05-13):

- ~~`_check_hot_space()` dead code~~ — now called in `_stage_shards()` and `_stage_precomputed()` with pre-scanned transfer size before any copies begin. `staging_margin_gb: 50` is now enforced.
- ~~GPU_TOKEN race~~ — `_start_training()` returns early when window is gone but `EXIT_CODE` not yet written.
- ~~Duplicate dispatch on restart~~ — `_stager_dispatched_errors` pre-seeded from `dispatch_queue.jsonl` via `_load_open_dispatch_ids()`.

**Remaining: validation gaps only (no known code bugs)**
- LAION/COYO/WikiArt download paths and chunk 3+ sequencing — code generalises correctly; untested at scale.
- Real two-device stager (cold→hot copy path) — `_check_hot_space()` now wired; needs a real `/Volumes/16TBCold` → `/Volumes/2TBSSD` transfer to verify. Will be exercised on the next pipeline run (PIPELINE-25 done, cold pool active).
- `stage.done` gate blocking training, `_poll_stager` retry after error, training crash one-retry + escalate — all coded correctly; never exercised end-to-end.
- GPU_TOKEN contention at production timing — documented; code fix applied; no observed failure.
- Download throttle stall false-positive — documented in DISPATCH.md Gap 6 as a known operator issue.
- `dispatch-resolve` UI-only clarification — documented in DISPATCH.md.

**PIPELINE-25b: Stream-convert downloads — eliminate raw tgz disk writes** (Low priority, long-term)

Currently `download_convert.py` downloads each JDB tgz to disk, then reads it back for conversion. Since downloads are sequential (one tgz at a time) and tgzs are small enough to hold in memory (~2-3 GB each, well within the 32 GB system RAM), the raw bytes could be streamed directly through `_convert_tgz()` without touching disk at all.

**When applicable:** only when `raw_pool_root` is not configured (i.e. no persistent raw pool needed). If the raw pool is enabled, the tgz must land on disk anyway. This optimisation targets the no-pool path or cases where the caller explicitly opts out of raw storage.

**How it would work:**
- `hf_hub_download()` supports a streaming/file-object mode; alternatively, download to a `tempfile.SpooledTemporaryFile` in memory.
- Pass the in-memory buffer directly to `tarfile.open(fileobj=buf, mode="r:gz")` inside `_convert_tgz()`.
- WebDataset output tar is written to disk as today (it is the persistent artifact).
- Eliminates one full disk write + one full disk read per tgz; saves ~2-3 GB × N tgzs of I/O.

**Constraint:** HuggingFace's `hf_hub_download` API always writes to a local path; would need to switch to `huggingface_hub.file_download.http_get()` or `requests` + streaming response to avoid the intermediate file. Alternatively, download to a RAM-backed tmpfs (`/dev/shm` on Linux; macOS has no equivalent — would need to use `tempfile` with a memory-sized cap). Investigate feasibility before committing to this path.

**Interaction with converted pool:** if `converted_pool_root` is set, the Level 0 hit (skip download+convert entirely) already makes this optimisation irrelevant for warm runs. This item only matters for the first-time conversion of each tgz.

## Flywheel Management

**FLYWHEEL-1: Long-term campaign management and cross-campaign analysis** (unblocked — PIPELINE-29 done)

Individual campaigns are managed by the orchestrator. This item is the layer above: tracking how quality evolves across campaigns over weeks and months, detecting when a campaign strategy is played out, and deciding when to launch a new campaign vs. continue the current one.

**Campaign lifecycle states:**
- **Active** — training flywheel running, metrics improving.
- **Plateau** — campaign-level cond_gap trend flat for N flywheel iterations (distinct from step-level plateau in the ablation harness, which is per-run). Triggers a recommendation to either change strategy (new ablation config) or warm-start a new campaign.
- **Completed** — operator-marked as done; weights archived; summary written to cold.
- **Superseded** — a later campaign has exceeded this one on all metrics; annotated in weight archive.

**Key capabilities:**

1. **Campaign-level plateau detection** — track rolling mean cond_gap and CLIP-I over the last N flywheel iterations (e.g. N=5). If neither metric has improved by more than `min_delta` for N iterations, emit a WARNING to the doctor and recommend: (a) launch a new ablation run to find a better config, or (b) warm-start a new campaign from a different checkpoint.

2. **Cross-campaign comparison** — powered by `data_explorer compare`. Answers: is campaign B better than campaign A? Are we regressing on CLIP-I while improving cond_gap? The flywheel logs in `metadata/flywheel_logs/` store per-iteration metrics to make this tractable.

3. **Warm-start decision support** — when a plateau is detected, `data_explorer suggest-warmstart` queries the weight archive and ablation history to recommend the highest-leverage starting point for the next campaign. Considers: best historical CLIP-I, which ablation configs are Pareto-optimal, and what training steps have already been covered to avoid redundant work.

4. **Campaign summary generation** — at the end of each campaign (or on demand), generate a structured summary: total steps, peak CLIP-I, cond_gap trajectory, ablation iterations run, shards consumed, wall-clock time. Written to `metadata/flywheel_logs/campaign-{date}.json` and to `weights/flywheel-{date}/summary.json`.

**Implementation:**
- `flywheel.py`: add `_campaign_plateau_check()`, `_write_campaign_summary()`.
- `pipeline_doctor.py`: surface campaign-level plateau as a WARNING with suggested next action.
- `data_explorer.py`: `compare` and `suggest-warmstart` subcommands (see PIPELINE-28).
- `metadata/flywheel_logs/`: structured JSON per iteration, written by `flywheel.py`.

## Known Bugs — Code Review 2026-05-15

32 of 33 bugs fixed — see COMPLETED_BACKLOG.md. One remains open:

**BUG-M-004: Batch mode atomicity broken in iris_gpu_attention_mps_bf16** — latent (harmless at current call sites)
`iris_metal.m` (~lines 3149–3151). Between Phase 2 (CPU softmax) and Phase 3 (scores @ V), the function unconditionally commits and resets `g_tensor_cmd` regardless of `g_tensor_batch_mode`. In batch mode this splits the attention's Phase 1 and Phase 3 across separate command buffers.

**Investigation findings (2026-05-15):** The only call site is `iris_gpu_attention_bf16` (line 3293), which calls `iris_gpu_sync()` at line 3270 *before* entering, flushing any prior batch work. Phase 1 and Phase 3 being in separate command buffers is an inherent constraint of the CPU softmax — it cannot be avoided without a GPU softmax kernel. Ordering is fully maintained. Current risk: zero. Proper fix: implement GPU softmax to eliminate the CPU readback; medium effort, not needed until a future model requires true bf16 batch-mode attention across this path.
