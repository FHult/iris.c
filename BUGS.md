# Bugs and Anomalies

## Pipeline Bugs (Fixed)

- **PIPE-1: Multi-chunk precomputed file collision** — When chunks 2–4 ran `build_shards.py`
  without `--start-idx`, all chunks started shard numbering from 000000. Staging shards for chunk 2
  produced the same internal record IDs (e.g. `000000_0000`) as chunk 1. On promotion, chunk 2's
  `precomputed/000000_0000.npz` overwrote chunk 1's file in the shared production `precomputed/`
  directory, corrupting training cache. **Fix**: orchestrator now passes `--start-idx (chunk-1)*250000`
  to `build_shards.py` so each chunk occupies a disjoint shard ID space (chunk 1: 0–249999,
  chunk 2: 250000–499999, etc.), and shards are promoted without renaming to preserve the stem↔npz match.

## Training Anomalies (Chunk 1 — Observed, Not Actionable Now)

- **ANOMALY-1: Shard-boundary stalls** — Two blocking stalls observed at step ~19,900 (55 min) and ~24,900 (2.6h). Root cause: epoch boundary + simultaneous JDB chunk 2 conversion competing for 2TBSSD I/O. Data% jumps to 100% in timing log. Both resolved automatically. Structural until pixel data is pre-cached to disk. See BACKLOG PIPELINE-3.

- **ANOMALY-2: Optimizer step spikes** — Isolated step-time spikes at steps 19,300 (2.4s vs normal 0.1s) and 25,900 (3.5s). Likely: gradient norm exceeded clip threshold (1.0) triggering full-parameter norm computation, or MLX lazy evaluator GC. No functional impact.
